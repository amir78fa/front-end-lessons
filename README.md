Animated Checkboxes Mini-Project: 
Checkboxes are animated through CSS3 transitions and add/remove functionality is implemented using jQuery. A cool font that goes by the name "Font Awesome" provides icons for a checked box and an unchecked box.

To play with this checklist, download the "animated checkboxes" folder and open checkboxes.html on your favorite browser (that's Chrome!).
