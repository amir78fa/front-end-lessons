Various (mini) Front-End Projects
=================

Under construction: Blackjack
--------------
Classic Blackjack game implemented with jQuery and CSS3. jQuery is used to interact with the user by proving the correct action buttons and score while CSS3 is responsible for the table and cards. Using card images is a simpler solution, but I'm learning CSS3 and it's always nice to cut down on http get requests.

+ The player will first select "Deal" to get a hand. 
+ Player can then decide to "Stand" or "Hit" 
+ Once a player's hand gets "busted" or decides to stand, the Dealer will take his/her turn. For reference, dealer stands on a soft 17.

Currently, I'm not accepting beats, letting you "double down", "split", or giving you the lame option to "surrender". Yes, I'm reading the wikipedia article on Blackjack.


Checklist with animated checkboxes
--------------
Checkboxes are animated through CSS3 transitions and add/remove functionality is implemented using jQuery. A cool font that goes by the name "Font Awesome" provides icons for a checked box and an unchecked box.

To play with this checklist, download the "animated checkboxes" folder and open checkboxes.html on your favorite browser (that's Chrome!). 


Calculator
--------------
A basic calculator coded with Javascript and CSS3. Pressed key's values are appended to an equation and evaluated when user presses "=". The calculator's 3D look is created with CSS box-shadows and transitions. The digital looking display font is Digital-7.

Multistep Form
--------------
This awesome multistep form allows users to tackle a small part of a form one piece at a time. It's less imitidating with animated form step changes and progress bar. 

It's implemented with jQuery and CSS3. The separate form components or fieldsets are positioned in a fixed manner. Changed in opacity and a bit of animation changes which fieldset is front and visible. User can press next and previous to navigate through the form and can see his or her progress to completion at all times. A jQuery easing plugin adds a smooth touch to fieldset changes.

All you need to run this is in "multistep form". Open "ms_form.html" to view it. 


Under construction: Magnify
--------------
Magnifying tool implemented with jQuery and CSS3. JQuery gets the cursor position and changes the background of a larger picture standing behind a smaller version, or thumbnail. CSS3 provides the necessary box shadows and border-radius properties to create a "magnifying glass."
