Multistep Form
--------------
This awesome multistep form allows users to tackle a small part of a form one piece at a time. It's less imitidating with animated form step changes and progress bar. 

It's implemented with jQuery and CSS3. The separate form components or fieldsets are positioned in a fixed manner. Changed in opacity and a bit of animation changes which fieldset is front and visible. User can press next and previous to navigate through the form and can see his or her progress to completion at all times. A jQuery easing plugin adds a smooth touch to fieldset changes. 

All you need to run this is in "multistep form". Open "ms_form.html" to view it.
