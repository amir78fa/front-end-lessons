Blackjack in Javascript
=================

why not?
--------------
The existance of this app is solely based on my interesting in developing my Javascript skills. There are two main objects: 1. Card, 2. Deck. 

-The player will first select "Deal" to get a hand. 
-Player can then decide to "Stand" or "Hit" 
-Once a player's hand gets "busted" or decides to stand, the Dealer will take his/her turn. For reference, dealer stands on a soft 17. 

Currently, I'm not accepting beats, letting you "double down", "split", or giving you the lame option to "surrender". Yes, I'm reading the wikipedia article on Blackjack.
